## Getting Started

This website mainly utilizes React for the front-end, Node.js for the server side. 

### Prerequisites

For development, you are required to install React and Node.js on your environement.


#### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v0.10.24

    $ npm --version
    1.3.21

##### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Please install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if it's not already done with the following command.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

If everything when fine, you should run

    brew install node

##### Node installation on Linux

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs

##### Node installation on Windows

Just go on [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) & grab the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it.

---

### Install and configure Node

    $ git clone git@github.com:WY0603/AIP.git
    $ cd AIP/server
    $ npm install

#### Start & watch

    $ npm start

#### Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

#### Update sources

Some packages usages might change so you should run `npm prune` & `npm install` often.
A common way to update is by doing

    $ git pull
    $ npm prune
    $ npm install

To run those 3 commands you can just do

    $ npm run pull

**Note:** Unix user can just link the `git-hooks/post-merge`:

#### Enable git hooks (unix only :/)

    $ npm run create-hook-symlinks

##### `post-merge` (≃ `npm install`)

This hook will `npm prune && npm install` each time you `git pull` something if the `package.json` has been modified.

##### `pre-commit` (≃ `npm test`)

This hook will just ensure you will commit something not broken bye pruning npm packages not in the `package.json` & eventually reinstall missings/not correctly removed packages.
Then it will try a production build.
